## PS:

I've been working in Business Application Development and Implementation projects for many years now. I've worked with employers like IBM, SAP in past and have been part of fairly large ERP projects of leading ERP as well as custom development projects in discreet manufacturing, continuous process and service industry. I know what is the minimum expectations from a serious core business application. Few of these are multi-company, multi-location, multi-currency, i18n-ready application. 

When it comes to Open Source Accounting and ERP projects, most options available in open source domain are not really serious options. I've been reviewing functionality of major open source Accounring and ERP projects, and found even basic functionality, process flow, business rules, checks and balances and reporting missing. Since my basic expertise is not programming, I've zeroed down on scalable tools that I can start with myself. The .Net, ABAP are mostly out of question due to possible licensing issues as the solution scales. Qt appears to be robust framework for the purpose, but I've selected Python (with Qt bindings) mainly due to simplicity with the same results as Qt. I've explored and zerod down on PySide6 and PostgreSQL as the primary development platform for Desktop based ERP possibly followed by Web based interface with DJango. Sphinx will be primary documentation tool.

Currently I'm documenting the basic functionality expected out of business application framework and working on  the proof of concept prototype and it will take time before I commit a meaningful alpha version. I'm also eagerly looking for members and contributors, partcularly with programming background, who are willing to join this project. If you're interested, you can contact me at the email address mentioned in my profile.
